# Pimcore Extensions Community

Pimcore is growing fast but extensions ecosystem is being left behind. This is why we decided to create Pimcore Extensions Community. We used to maintain some Community plugins here as well, but, as you know, time goes on and maintainence got left behind. Therefore we deprecated and abandoned a lof of the old stuff. But, good news: We still keep this list with useful plugins up-to-date :) :beers: 

If you have extensions, plugins, blog articles, tips&tricks about pimcore and you wan't to share with community leave a note through the issue tracker of this project.
